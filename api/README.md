# API Definitions

This directory contains API definitions for the Half-Tunnel system.

## Contents

- Protocol buffer definitions (if cross-language interop is needed)
- OpenAPI specifications for HTTP APIs
- gRPC service definitions

## Note

For Phase 1, the Half-Tunnel protocol uses a hand-rolled binary format.
Protobuf definitions will be added if cross-language client support is needed.
